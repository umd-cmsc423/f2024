As I will be traveling back to the US during our scheduled class time, we wonâ€™t have a lecture tomorrow, Thurs. Sept 12.  Class will resume as normal next Tues, when project 2 will be released, I will answer any questions folks have about semi-numerical string matching, and we will start talking about text indexing for faster queries.
