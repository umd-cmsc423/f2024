Today in class, we will have a guest lecture from Prof. Mihai Pop.
He will talk about semi-numerical string matching and the Rabin-Karp
algorithm.

This is the next subject on our syllabus, and this material will be 
on the midterm, so be sure to attend!  The slides are posted on
the course website, and we're happy to take any questions on Piazza.
Also; Rabin-Karp is a very cool idea; don't miss it!
